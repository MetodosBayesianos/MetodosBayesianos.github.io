                <!--<p>
                The current state of real science is too far away from the most modest of ideals.
                </p>-->

                <p>
                Since the 18th century we have had a well-defined and intuitive system of reasoning that allows us to reach truths in contexts of uncertainty, intersubjective agreements with universal validity.
                However, at the same time, the colonial-modern front was initiating the era of genocides and the massive loss of cultural diversity on a global scale.
                In a world of weakened communities, the individualistic and instrumental worldview of our time expands, commodifying all forms of life and thus leading to the current massive loss of biodiversity.
                Despite all the advances, metropolitan science is still unable to compensate for the loss of millenarian knowledge caused by colonial-modernity, and as a consequence the ecological crisis continues to deepen.
                </p>

                <h5 class="header col s12 light">
                    1. Intersubjective agreements.
                </h5>

                <p>
                The strict application of the rules of probability that guarantees intersubjective agreements in contexts of uncertainty (Bayesian approach) has also been shown to be optimal in practical terms.
                Since its mathematical formalization in the 18th century, no alternative offering better results has been proposed so far.
                However, the absolute majority of researchers are still unaware of its existence today, in the 21st century.
                Although knowledge under uncertainty is "plural and conditional", hegemonic science treats it as if it were "singular and definite".
                This is how an enormous amount of energy is currently burned to develop artificial "intelligence" algorithms incapable, by design, of computing their own uncertainty.
                While algorithms without intelligence are admired, the source of all intelligence, life, continues to be endangered.
                </p>

                <h5 class="header col s12 light">
                    2. The cost function.
                </h5>

                <p>
                Not just any cost function allows us to create intelligent information systems.
                The evolutionary selection processes of life forms, by sequence of survival and reproduction rates, are like the selection processes of hypotheses in the reasoning of intersubjective agreements, by sequences of predictions, multiplicative in nature.
                Because in them the impacts of losses are stronger than those of gains (a zero in the sequence produces an irreversible extinction), the variants that flourish are hypotheses or life forms that reduce fluctuations by individual diversification (epistemic property), by cooperation (evolutionary property), by cooperative specialization (speciation property), and by cooperative heterogeneity (ecological property).
                </p>

                <h5 class="header col s12 light">
                    3. Mayor property.
                </h5>

                <p>
                However, the colonial-modern worldview continues to believe that cooperation is at a disadvantage with respect to individualism.
                There is no such dilemma because in multiplicative selection processes, defecting individuals increase the fluctuations of the cooperators on whom they depend, increasing  therefore their own fluctuations and negatively affecting their own long-term growth rate (mayor property).
                While certain conjunctures may favor defection in the short term (minor property), the emergence of higher level cooperative units is a permanent phenomenon in the history of life (major evolutionary transitions).
                Our own life depends on at least four of these levels for survival: the cell with mitochondria, the multicellular organism, the social system and the ecological community.
                </p>

                <h5 class="header col s12 light">
                    4. The accumulated experience.
                </h5>

                <p>
                The advantage in favor of diversification and cooperation is not only theoretical, it has consequences for life and knowledge.
                In the history of human beings, the cultural transition had obvious positive effects: before epistemic cooperation (transmission of knowledge) we were in serious danger of extinction; then we were able to occupy all the ecological niches of the earth as no other terrestrial vertebrate.
                Unlike ad-hoc approaches that select a single hypothesis (e.g.~by maximum likelihood), reasoning under uncertainty works only when mutually contradictory hypotheses (A and not A) are considered at the same time.
                And those hypotheses do not come out of the blue.
                It is the experience that communities accumulate over time where causal arguments relevant to each particular context are developed.
                </p>

                <h5 class="header col s12 light">
                    5. The relevance.
                </h5>

                <p>
                Not all truth is equally relevant.
                The very concept of "problem" only makes sense in relation to some living system.
                The problems of knowledge are, directly or indirectly, a function of a set of real problems, and from them it gets its relevance and hierarchy.
                Although scientific problems are usually expressed only in relation to their theoretical aspects, it is of great importance to uncover the system of relations that lead to their real basis.
                The problems of physics and chemistry exist insofar as they are subsumed as relevant to the reproduction of life, linked to a historical and evolutionary context.
                The way problems are formulated orients from the outset the type of questions, the data that are selected, the causal models that are considered, and thus the possible space of answers.
                Therefore, examining contexts is a decisive task in determining the relevance of knowledge problems.
                </p>

                <h5 class="header col s12 light">
                    5. Tailor-made for each problem.
                </h5>

                <p>
                In sensitive areas where it is necessary to intervene on the system itself (epidemiology, forensic science, environmental impact, among others) many human resources are currently devoted to build the elements of proof (data, indicators, evidence) and to propose alternative causal arguments to explain it.
                In order to make the most of these existing resources, the strict application of the rules of probability is sometimes important.
                Over the last decades, several techniques have been developed that allow us to create and evaluate models tailored to the problem, in an intuitive way.
                With them we can: express graphically the causal relationships between variables; decompose the rules of probability as messages between the nodes of the causal network; and delegate the inference to probabilistic programming languages.
