## Bayesian Methods Lab

This is the Bayesian Methods Lab.
We work on the technical, practical and theoretical aspects of the Bayesian approach to probability theory, developing methods to optimally solve empirical problems in industry, politics and ecology.

### Intersubjective agreements in contexts of uncertainty

Unlike the formal sciences, which validate their propositions within closed axiomatic systems, the empirical sciences (from physics to the social sciences) must validate their propositions in open systems that by definition always contain some degree of uncertainty. Is it possible to reach "truths" if it is inevitable to say "I don't know"? Yes. The strict application of the rules of probability (Bayesian approach) guarantees intersubjective agreements in contexts of uncertainty, the foundation of empirical truths. Under uncertainty it becomes necessary to believe at the same time in A and not A so the surprise, the only source of information, acts as a filter of the previous beliefs. This selection process (sequence of filters) is like the evolutionary one (sequence of reproduction and survival) of multiplicative nature. A single zero in the sequence generates an irreversible extinction. Thus there is an advantage in favor of life forms and empirical knowledge that reduce fluctuations by diversification, cooperation, specialization and coexistence. While the strict application of probability theory has been shown to be the ideal logic in contexts of uncertainty, its adoption was historically limited due to the associated high computational cost. The Bayesian approach, unlike the frequentist one, updates the beliefs of each and every hypothesis according to empirical and formal evidence (data and causal models). Although in the last decades the computational limitations have been largely overcome thanks to the development of efficient approximation methods, historical inertia is now its main limitation. **The Bayesian Methods Lab aims to promote the adoption of the Bayesian approach to probability as a general method for reaching inter-subjective agreements in contexts of uncertainty, in science, politics and ecology**
